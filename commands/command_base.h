// The classes derived from Command::Base represent units-of-work, which can be exectuted / undone
// repeatedly. The command objects are collected in a linear list implemented in the QUndoStack class.
// They contain the information that is necessary to either perform or undo the unit-of-work.
// The usage is:
//	constructor: generate information that is needed for executing the unit-of-work
//	redo(): performs the unit-of-work and generates the information that is needed for undo()
//	undo(): undos the unit-of-work and regenerates the initial information needed in redo()
// The needed information is mostly kept in pointers to dives and/or trips, which have to be added
// or removed.
// For this to work it is crucial that
// 1) Pointers to dives and trips remain valid as long as referencing command-objects exist.
// 2) The dive-table is not resorted, because dives are inserted at given indices.
//
// Thus, if a command deletes a dive or a trip, the actual object must not be deleted. Instead,
// the command object removes pointers to the dive/trip object from the backend and takes ownership.
// To reverse such a deletion, the object is re-injected into the backend and ownership is given up.
// Once ownership of a dive is taken, any reference to it was removed from the backend. Thus,
// subsequent redo()/undo() actions cannot access this object and integrity of the data is ensured.
//
// As an example, consider the following course of events: Dive 1 is renumbered and deleted, dive 2
// is added and renumbered. The undo list looks like this (---> non-owning, ***> owning pointers,
// ===> next item in list)

// Note:
// 1) Dive 2 was deleted with the "add dive 2" command, because that was the owner.
// 2) Dive 1 was not deleted, because it is owned by the backend.
//
// To take ownership of dives/trips, the OnwingDivePtr and OwningTripPtr types are used. These
// are simply derived from std::unique_ptr and therefore use well-established semantics.
// Expressed in C-terms: std::unique_ptr<T> is exactly the same as T* with the following
// twists:
// 1) default-initialized to NULL.
// 2) if it goes out of scope (local scope or containing object destroyed), it does:
//	if (ptr) free_function(ptr);
//    whereby free_function can be configured (defaults to delete ptr).
// 3) assignment between two std::unique_ptr<T> compiles only if the source is reset (to NULL).
//    (hence the name - there's a *unique* owner).
// While this sounds trivial, experience shows that this distinctly simplifies memory-management
// (it's not necessary to manually delete all vector items in the destructur, etc).
// Note that Qt's own implementation (QScoperPointer) is not up to the job, because it doesn't implement
// move-semantics and Qt's containers are incompatible, owing to COW semantics.
//
// Usage:
//	OwningDivePtr dPtr;			// Initialize to null-state: not owning any dive.
//	OwningDivePtr dPtr(dive);		// Take ownership of dive (which is of type struct dive *).
//						// If dPtr goes out of scope, the dive will be freed with free_dive().
//	struct dive *d = dPtr.release();	// Give up ownership of dive. dPtr is reset to null.
//	struct dive *d = d.get();		// Get pointer dive, but don't release ownership.
//	dPtr.reset(dive2);			// Delete currently owned dive with free_dive() and get ownership of dive2.
//	dPtr.reset();				// Delete currently owned dive and reset to null.
//	dPtr2 = dPtr1;				// Fails to compile.
//	dPtr2 = std::move(dPtr1);		// dPtr2 takes ownership, dPtr1 is reset to null.
//	OwningDivePtr fun();
//	dPtr1 = fun();				// Compiles. Simply put: the compiler knows that the result of fun() will
//						// be trashed and therefore can be moved-from.
//	std::vector<OwningDivePtr> v:		// Define an empty vector of owning pointers.
//	v.emplace_back(dive);			// Take ownership of dive and add at end of vector
//						// If the vector goes out of scope, all dives will be freed with free_dive().
//	v.clear(v);				// Reset the vector to zero length. If the elements weren't release()d,
//						// the pointed-to dives are freed with free_dive()
